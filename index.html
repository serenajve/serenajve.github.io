		<p>SERENA JV ELSTON</p>
		<p>About</p>
		<p>Serena is an architectural artist who’s life question is: in this modern technological race for the new, what have we left behind that we should weave back in again? The narrative of her artwork deals with trauma and the dysfunction that persists throughout all levels of society.  Her practice uses transmutation in an attempt to resolve the unresolvable. Using the disciplines of architecture, agriculture, and ancient history in her practice to addresses all levels of self actualization and self fulfillment. Serena searches for those forgotten tools that connect us to the land, to the people, and to ourselves because in a world defined by its traumas art can be liberatory.

Elston holds a BFA in Architecture and Sculpture from Massachusetts College of Art & Design and has a decade of experience in construction and big art production. She has led teams of both volunteers and professionals for a diversity of projects and taught workshops teaching her participatory design/build approach. She is currently researching and developing a body of work around the role of olive oil as the  fuel of civilization.</p>
